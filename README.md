# React + Vite + TSX

A repository of my React website that uses Lanyard API to fetch real-time Discord Activites. 


## Executing the Webpage

To execute the webpage, you will need to first clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trollmeight/react.git
cd react
```
Once the task is finished, write inside of your terminal:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
The website should start on [localhost](https://localhost:5173) once you have finished that process.
