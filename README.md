# React + Vite + TSX

A repository of my React website that uses Lanyard API to fetch real-time Discord Activites. 


## Executing the Webpage

To execute the webpage, you will need to first clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trollmeight/react.git
cd react
```
Once the task is finished, write inside of your terminal:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
The HTML files for the website have been compiled successfully. You can now use any other service to host the HTML files onto a domain.
